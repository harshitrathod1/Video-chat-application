# Video-chat-application
Created a Web based zoom clone which is a video chat application.
Used NodeJS for backend and HTML CSS with EJS for the frontend.

This app achieves peer to peer connection using PeerJS which one of the wrapper over WebRTC.
Sending Message and stream over the web sockets is done using socket.io node library.
Special roomId is being generated using uuid node library.

Improvements needed :-

1. Add function to leave meeting button
2. Display user_name over chat window
3. Handle frontend to display multiple users.
4. Display some dummy icon when users presses stop video.

Feel free to add more.
